# myRunningApp
A mobile application to track running and compete with friends to accomplish fitness goals without big-corporation branding.

Motivations behind creating this app:
- I want something that encourages regular running routines with my partner
- I like the leaderboards of monthly challenges of popular challenges like Nike Run Club, but the challenge leaderboards are full of  members that log inaccurate data which ruins the fun of a leaderboard. I want to provide a solution which helps create smaller groups so members of the groups don't have to compete with inaccurate users, and promote socialization between the members of the small groups.
- I want data visualization components which are motivating to runners to see because it promotes positive self reflection.
- I want to create an IOS app that familiarizes myself with how to track fitness with their APIs.
